This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for [The Sparks Foundation.](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)
- **Internship Category** - Data Science and Business Analytics
- **Internship Duration** - 1 Month ( January-2021 )
- **Internship Type** - Work from Home


In this internship, I successfully completed 5 tasks as given below:



###  Task : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)


1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
1. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
1. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
1. Dataset can also be found at [http://bit.ly/w-data](http://bit.ly/w-data)
1. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

###  Task : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)


1. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
1. Use R or Python or perform this task.
1. Dataset can also be found at [https://bit.ly/3kXTdox](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox)

###  Task : Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Level - Beginner)


1. Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
1. As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can
work to make more profit. 
1. What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data? 
1. You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS) 
1. Dataset can also be found at [https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl](https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl)

###  Task : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)


1. Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
1. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
1. Dataset can also be found at [https://bit.ly/3kXTdox](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox)

###  Task : Timeline Analysis : Covid-19 (Level - Advanced)


1. Create a storyboard showing spread of Covid-19 cases in your country or
any region (Asia, Europe, BRICS etc) using Tableau, Power BI or SAP
1. Use animation, timeline and annotations to create attractive and interactive
dashboards and story
1. Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid-19 spread
with basic as well as advanced charts
1. Screen-record the completed storyboard along with your audio explaining the
charts and giving recommendations
1. Dataset: Daily updated .csv file on [https://bit.ly/30d2gdi](https://bit.ly/30d2gdi)
